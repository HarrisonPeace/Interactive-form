# full-stack-javascript-interactive-form

<h3>For this project I added in the JavaScript to make the form interactive | the CSS and HTML was supplied by Treehouse.<h3/>
  
<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>I used accessibility practises to make the form easily filed out but all users.</p>
<p>The flow of the form is fluid and east to follow if using the tab key.</p>
<p>A custom focus class is assigned to the checkbox’s container when it is in focus so that it is easy identifiable.</p>

<h4>Real-time error message</h4>
<p>I added real time error messaging to all fields that had specific requirements needed.</p>
<p>I also added real time error messaging for all required fields after the user tries to submit the form for the first time so that they can see when all errors have been fixes without having to try to submit the form again.</p>

<h4>Conditional error message</h4>
<p>I added in conditional error messaging for the credit card fields of NUMBER, ZIP and SVV so that a specific error message would show if the user enters anything that doesn’t represent a number as required.</p>
